Notes:
  View Profile functionality was not something included in our proposal, but we
  decided it made sense to let people see their own profile.
  Profiles will ideally have an image associated with them that can be
  uploaded to the storage server from the device. However that functionality
  has not been completed at this time. Phase 2 will have profile images.
  Layouts are currently optimized for use with phones, but one of our goals for
  Phase 2 will be to have alternate layouts for large screens.
  The search functionality is not likely to bring up many hits for complex
  queries based on a small sample of users. For testing purposes, try keeping
  it simple. For styles, maybe try "Rock" or "Jazz". City, Tacoma? For testing
  multiple parameters, Guitar, Rock, 29, Tacoma will bring up a result.
